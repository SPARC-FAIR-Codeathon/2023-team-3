    "# Tutorial 5: Running a workflow on cloud platform using Dockstore\n",
    "This tutorial sparc-flow to run the standardised workflow described in Tutorial 2 on a cloud platform () using Dockstore.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General introduction\n",
    "From dockstore official best practice for [register a workflow on dockstore](https://docs.dockstore.org/en/stable/getting-started/dockstore-workflows.html), it is recommand us use Github repository to connect Dockstore Github app.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what we can do are:\n",
    "  - Create a Github account.\n",
    "  - Create a dockstore account.\n",
    "  - Prepare the workflow project.\n",
    "  - [Create a .dockstore.yml file](https://docs.dockstore.org/en/stable/getting-started/github-apps/github-apps.html), this is for dockstore automatically sysc with Github.\n",
    "  - Follow the [guideline](https://docs.dockstore.org/en/stable/getting-started/dockstore-workflows.html), to create a repository and load the workflow code inside, then connect the dockstore. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Prepare workflow project\n",
    "From tutorial 3 we've already use workflow.load function to move the tools into workflow folder. So now we have the entire prejects under workflow dataset primary folder (workflow + tools + data), the path is `./resources/workflow_dataset/primary/workflow`. These are almost files that dockstore cloud needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we want dockstore cloud automatically sysc grab the code from GitHub repository, we need a .dockstore.yml file. Don't need to worry about how to manually write this file. Our `sparc_flow` can help you to create it programmatically. It has a generate_dockstore_github_requirements() api, so we can just do:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "  workflow.generate_dockstore_github_requirements(workflow_path=\"/workflow.cwl\",  output_path=\"./\", paras_path_arr=[\"/inp_job.json\"],name=\"your_name\", email=\"your@gmail.com\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "It will automatically generate a .dockstore.yml file for you. And remember, this file should under the same folder with workflow.cwl.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Push the project into your GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here we should noticed, the each GitHub repository branches are dockstore workflow's versions.\n",
    "- If we have multiple branches, in the dockstore we will have multiple versions.\n",
    "- Here is a our simple workflow project example on GitHub repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/github01.png\" alt=\"github_repo\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Publish the workflow\n",
    "- Follow the [guideline](https://docs.dockstore.org/en/stable/getting-started/dockstore-workflows.html) to connect dockstore and GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After you connect it, the workflow will appear in your dockstore dashboard's workflow tag. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/dock01.png\" alt=\"dockstore unpublish\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initial it is unpulish status, if you have multiple versions here, you need to choose one and set it to default, then publish it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/dock02.png\" alt=\"dockstore publish\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- After you publish the wolkflow, it will appear in public page, so everyone can use it locally and on cloud platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Run workflow on CGC ([Cancer Genomics Cloud](https://docs.dockstore.org/en/stable/launch-with/cgc-launch-with.html)) \n",
    "- After publish workflow, in the public page, we can find the right corner shows information about which cloud platforms can run the workflow. It depends on which workflow language we are choosing. For example, if we use [CWL](https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/introduction/quick-start.html) (Common workflow language), it can be running at CGC, NHLBI BioData Catalyst and Cavatica platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here is an example that we run our workflow on CGC\n",
    "  - Click the CGC button.\n",
    "  - Sign up an account for CGC.\n",
    "  - Create a work project for import workflow from dockstore.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here is how the workflow runs in CGC\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/cgc01.png\" alt=\"cgc app\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we click `RUN` button, our workflow will start to execute on the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/cgc02.png\" alt=\"cgc app\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "  - In here, the workflow starts to run, it lets us to type a number as input. \n",
    "  - We haven't see the result, because we haven't top up money on this platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Run workflow locally via GitHub and Dockstore\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/dock03.png\" alt=\"dockstore publish\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the dockstore workflow public pages, we can click the `launch`, that allow us run the workflow via dockstore CLI. \n",
    "- For doing this:\n",
    "  - Make sure you've already setup the dockstore CLI locally through tutorial_4\n",
    "  - Create a empty folder on the desktop\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "      cd the/empty/folder\n",
    "\n",
    "      conda activate cwl-dockstore-env\n",
    "      \n",
    "      dockstore workflow convert entry2json --entry github.com/your-Github-account/your-repository:main > Dockstore.json\n",
    "\n",
    "      cwltool \\#workflow/github.com/your-Github-account/your-repository:main Dockstore.json\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - After this the workflow will run locally via dockstore and Github.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "pip install sparc_flow\n",
