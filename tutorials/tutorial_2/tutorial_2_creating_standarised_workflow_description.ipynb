    "# Tutorial 2: Creating standardised workflow description\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to create a standardised work flow (CWL) description using the sparc_flow package for the same operations as seen in tutorial 1. At each step of the process the CWL file is saved within a SDS structure in keeping with FAIR principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure our workflow adheres to the FAIR principles:\n",
    "- We published our workflow, along with the metadata, on Dockstore. This makes it easily findable for those interested in using it.\n",
    "- We chose Dockstore for publishing our workflow to promote its accessibility as Dockstore does not require users to sign in to search for published content. In the future, we will obtain a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for our workflow via Zenodo through Dockstore, ensuring it can be readily accessed by interested parties.\n",
    "- We employed CWL to describe our workflow to ensure our workflow is interoperable. CWL is designed to describe workflows in an environment-agnostic and portable way, making them compatible across various platforms including Dockstore. We also provided a parameter file (JSON) contaiining example parameters for lauching our workflow.\n",
    "- We provided a thorough README in the git repository to ensure the workflowâ€™s reusability. Our sparc-flow module is fully open source and distributed under the very permissive Apache License 2.0 as stated in the README.\n",
